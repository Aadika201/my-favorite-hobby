  <h2> My Hobby </h2>
  <h4> Baking </h4>
  <p>The baking method is used to make cakes, cookies, crackers, pastries, pies, pretzels, puddings, quiches, scones, pies and more. Together, they are called “baked goods” and can be found in most bakeries using traditional and modern cooking techniques. In addition to these food categories, meat and meat products may also be cooked, but these are usually fried when the meat is used as a stuffing covered with a crust of bread or dough.

    the Roman art of baking became known throughout Europe and eventually spread to eastern parts of Asia. By the 13th century in London, commercial trading, including baking, had many regulations attached. In the case of food, they were designed to create a system "so there was little possibility of false measures, adulterated food or shoddy manufactures." There were by that time twenty regulations applying to bakers alone, including that every baker had to have "the impression of his seal" upon bread.

    Beginning in the 19th century, alternative leavening agents became more common, such as baking soda. Bakers often baked goods at home and then sold them in the streets. This scene was so common that Rembrandt, among others, painted a pastry chef selling pancakes in the streets of Germany, with children clamoring for a sample. In London, pastry chefs sold their goods from handcarts. This developed into a delivery system of baked goods to households and greatly increased demand as a result. In Paris, the first open-air café of baked goods was developed, and baking became an established art throughout the entire world.
